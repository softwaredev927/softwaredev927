Tokenomics proposal to achieve community consensus on circulating supply of TON. Proposal for a 48 month temporary freeze of inactive mining wallets, which have never been activated and do not have any outgoing transfer in their history.

In response to repeated requests for greater certainty, clarity and transparency over the tokenomics of the TON network on December 17, 2022, the community called for all early miners to activate their inactive mining wallets by the end of 2022.

Out of the 204 inactive mining wallets identified by the community, 182 wallets remain inactive as of February 14, 2023. 182 wallets constitute less than 0.009% of the total number of wallets on the network. These mining wallets --- the genesis wallets which have mined Toncoin directly from the Proof-of-Work smart-contracts --- have never been activated and do not have a single outgoing transfer in their history. The full list of inactive mining wallet addresses can be found [here](https://tontech.io/stats/early-miners), which is also specified in the [proposal smart-contract.](https://verifier.ton.org/0:95cb96c458b419ae1e4f61bd6e3f71523bbc6de0aa1bca7e13f691b2d9ce7e8b)

Any address that becomes active prior to the network voting shall be excluded from this list. The network voting by the validators is expected to take place on or around February 21, 2023.

Toncoin acts as a gas fee required to obtain access to decentralized services on the TON network. It has been widely speculated that access to these inactive wallets may have been lost. What is clear is that there is a community consensus: the existence of these unutilized Toncoin only increases the uncertainty for network participants.

In spite of some community members proposing for a permanent inactivation, a large part of the community was in favor of preserving the very idea that keeps us together: decentralization. For this reason, we are suggesting this inactivation period to last temporarily for 48 months. This will give the TON ecosystem enough time to flourish while providing flexibility to those who may not be aware of these discussions in the community.

TON is a community-driven blockchain and we believe that the network validators should listen to the voice of the community as a whole. Therefore, we are suggesting every Toncoin holder to participate in this vote ahead of the network voting. It is momentous that everyone participates in this new chapter of TON's history.

Make your voice heard.

Disclaimer: the voting results on ton.vote will not have a direct impact on the network voting. However, the community believes that the network validators will consider the voice of the community seriously.
